# Flux Constitution

## Introduction

This is the constitution for the political party known as "VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!", sometimes referred to as "Flux" or "the party" in this document.

Flux is hereby established as an organization.

The canonical version of the constitution is stored in the repository at https://github.com/voteflux/flux/

Clauses should be referred to by line number and most recent commit hash.

## Objective

The primary objective of Flux is to promote the election of endorsed candidates to the Senate and House of Representatives. 
Promotion and endorsement of candidates will be contextually appropriate.

Further objectives:

* To provide every Australian voter with real democratic potential
* To use elected parliamentarians as a gateway for members to directly influence parliament within Australian law, using an internal voting system
* To provide the framework and means for minor parties and independents to participate productively without winning a seat
* To facilitate a culture of criticism through empowering specialists and passionate voters
* To stimulate the creation of new policy options

## Membership Criteria

Flux's membership criteria are:

* Maintain a list of at least 500 members who are on the Australian electoral roll
* or, Have at least 1 member who is a parliamentarian

### Membership

All Australian voters are eligible for membership. 
There is no cost for membership.
Each member is required to provide their name and address such that it matches the electoral roll.
Other required details include methods of contact, an email address is required, a phone number is optional.
Their membership application is to be submitted through Flux's website, at https://voteflux.org.
Members may resign or revoke their membership through the resignation feature on the member's membership details page.

To retain membership, after at least one Flux parliamentarian has been elected, members will need to (once a year) confirm their details are up to date through an email notification.
Each time this happens their membership is valid for 1 year and they are granted voting rights within Flux's internal voting system.

There are no obligations outside of maintaining membership.

Parliamentarians who are members of Flux are not permitted to be members of other political parties.
In a case where a parliamentarian does find themselves a member of another party, they must immediately resign from that other party.

Members may be expelled from the party only in the case it is agreed upon unanimously by the Leadership, and a member who has nominated for an internal election may not be expelled until 60 days after the results of the election have been published.

State and Territory branches may use the name "Flux" and associated branding elements when they have been created as a subsection here, as is the case with `ACT Branch` below.

### ACT Branch

The ACT branch of the Flux party is to be established with the constitution contained in the `CONSTITUTION.ACT.md` document in the root of this repository.
This constitution can be found at: https://github.com/voteflux/flux/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.ACT.md

`CONSTITUTION.ACT.md` is accepted and ratified as the opening constitution of Flux ACT as defined in commit `c37c68126e3c9d354d8bb66496d8efd6d9b35caa` which is verified (and provided) at the following URL: https://github.com/voteflux/flux/blob/c37c68126e3c9d354d8bb66496d8efd6d9b35caa/CONSTITUTION.ACT.md (note the commit hash - the long string of randomish letters and numbers - matches the commit hash in the URL, indicating the document is correct and not tampered with).

## Internal Voting System

Flux will use an internal voting system to

* Facilitate members participating in the parliamentary process
* Facilitate minor parties and independents' productive participation without winning a seat

The parameters and design choices of the system are left to the Leader, and not within the scope of this document.
There is no requirement that the voting system for members is the same as the voting system for minor parties.
